# Patterns Kompakt Source Code

This repository contains executable examples to illustrate and demonstrate patterns described in our book _[Patterns Kompakt - Entwurfsmuster f√ºr effektive Softwareentwicklung, Verlag Springer Vieweg, 2019](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783662579367)_.

Information in German and a quick start project download can be found at the book's website [patterns-kompakt.de](http://patterns-kompakt.de).

## Project Setup

The repository contains Java code and runs as a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)-build. Until Java 7 the project was entirely independent and just leveraging classes contained in the JDK. Because since then the JDK has been trimmed considerably, the example code base was reshaped into a Maven project with a couple of external dependencies. While this may be an extra hurdle for newbees it increases flexibility a lot and better meets common standards and best practices. 

Besides a working git installation for cloning the repository you need:

* Java JDK 15 (i.e. [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/))
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.6.3 (older versions may work as well)

Once done with the preparation simply run `mvn clean install`. This will run tests for all patterns with minimal logging. The first time it may take a while to download the maven artifacts the project depends on.


### Recommendations

* Install any IDE (i.e. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)) for easier coding and better overview.
* [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) can help preventing bugs, and due to its built-in documentation it gives valuable insights about the programming language. At least I learned a lot by reviewing the reasoning behind the SonarLint rules.
* At the time of writing I am using [Linux MINT](https://linuxmint.com/) inside a [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This way, you don't need to worry about ruining your installation with a different JDK, IDE or Maven.
* [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a light-weight way to do necessary documentation _along with your code_. For editing on Linux I use [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter), which I found easy to install and pretty intuitive. On MacOS I use [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/).
* I use here a minimalistic template to introduce each scenario and describe a particular pattern. For lean documention of real projects I recommend taking a look at [arc42](https://docs.arc42.org/home/).

## Package Structure

I have organized the patterns as separate packages with [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) test cases to demonstrate each pattern. 

Every scenario is documented in a dedicated Markdown file. By intention I have chosen different scenarios than those described in the book, for practical programming reasons on the one hand and on the other hand to give the readers a second view on each pattern. Leveraging test cases allowed me to separate setup and dynamic demonstration aspects from the class structure of a pattern.

By adjusting the log-level ([SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/)+[Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/)) you can watch a pattern _at work_. The pattern examples do not depend on each other, so that (besides a few utility classes) you have maximum cohesion and focus inside a pattern's package.

I invite you to experiment with the patterns and to think about the choice that was made. Maybe you will come to the conclusion that a different pattern would have been better for a particular scenario?

Most important: **Have fun! :smirk:**
